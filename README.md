# OpenSEO

An open-source SEO audit tool you run yourself. Paste a URL and, about 15 seconds later, get a
graded report (A+ to F) across on-page SEO, performance, usability, security, links, social and
AI search readiness, with the fixes ranked by how much they matter.

No paid APIs, no account, no database to set up.

OpenSEO is an independent project inspired by hosted audit tools like SEOptimer. It is not
affiliated with any of them.

## What it does

- **Audits a page with ~70 checks** in seven categories, each with its own grade, weighted into
  one overall score.
- **Tells you what to fix first**: problems are ranked by priority, and every one says how to
  fix it, with the evidence (the tags it found, the slow files, the broken links).
- **Crawls a whole site**: follows links page by page and finds broken pages, missing or
  duplicate titles and descriptions, missing H1s, thin content, slow pages and noindex.
- **Keeps a history** of every audit with shareable links and each site's score over time.
- **Monitors pages**: re-audits them every day or week and alerts you by email, Slack, Discord
  or webhook when the score drops, a page stops loading or its SSL certificate is about to
  expire.
- **Compares two audits**: the same page before and after a deploy, or your page next to a
  competitor's, with the score, each category and every check that got better or worse. Each
  comparison has a shareable link, like a report.
- **Exports** reports as PDF (print-ready) and JSON, and crawls as CSV.
- **White-label reports**: your name, logo, accent color, footer and a call to action button,
  set in `data/settings.json`.
- **Has an API, a CLI and a GitHub Action** that fails a pull request when its preview deploy
  scores lower than production or breaks a check.
- **Works with AI assistants**: a built-in MCP server lets Claude, Cursor and other AI tools run
  audits, read reports, compare them, crawl sites and set up monitors.
- **Checks AI search readiness**: whether ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity can crawl and quote the
  page, llms.txt, server-rendered content and entity markup.
- **Shows how your links look when shared** on Google, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Slack, Discord,
  WhatsApp and iMessage, following each platform's rules for image size and card type. It also
  measures the share image and every favicon, Apple touch icon and web app manifest icon. It's
  part of every report and works on its own as Share preview.

Checks that pass earn their full weight, warnings half, failures nothing. Informational checks
(like the search result preview) are shown but not scored.

## Run it

All you need is [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker
Engine on Linux). Start OpenSEO with:

```bash
docker run -d --name openseo --restart unless-stopped -p 3000:3000 -v openseo-data:/data ghcr.io/alexsilver8/open-seo
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and paste a URL. OpenSEO keeps running in the
background and starts again with Docker. Reports, crawls and settings live in the `openseo-data`
volume, so they survive restarts and updates. The image works on Intel and Apple silicon.

| To                    | Run                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stop it               | `docker stop openseo`                                                                 |
| Start it again        | `docker start openseo`                                                                |
| See what it's doing   | `docker logs -f openseo`                                                              |
| Update to the latest  | `docker pull ghcr.io/alexsilver8/open-seo`, then `docker rm -f openseo` and run again |
| Use another port      | Change `-p 3000:3000` to `-p 8080:3000`                                               |
| Delete all saved data | `docker rm -f openseo && docker volume rm openseo-data`                               |

To turn on Core Web Vitals, add a free PageSpeed API key under **Settings** in the app. Other
options from the table below go in with `-e`, like `-e ADMIN_PASSWORD=…`.

To audit a site running on your own computer, add
`-e OPENSEO_ALLOW_PRIVATE=true --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to the command and
use `http://host.docker.internal:<port>` instead of `localhost` (inside Docker, `localhost` is
OpenSEO itself).

### Build it from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexsilver8/open-seo.git
cd open-seo
docker compose up -d
```

The first build takes a few minutes. With Compose, put options in a `.env` file next to
`docker-compose.yml`; `docker compose up -d --build` picks up new code after a `git pull`.

### Without Docker

Requires Node.js 22.12 or newer and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) 12
(`npm install -g pnpm` if you don't have it).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev             # http://localhost:3000
```

Or for a faster production build: `pnpm build && pnpm start`.

### Settings

Everything below is optional. With `docker run`, pass them with `-e`; with Compose, put them in a
`.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`; without Docker, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.

| Variable                 | Does                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PAGESPEED_API_KEY`      | A free Google PageSpeed key for Core Web Vitals and screenshots. You can also add it in Settings   |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`         | Asks for a password (user `admin`) on history, the crawler and settings                            |
| `OPENSEO_DATA_DIR`       | Where data is stored. Defaults to `./data`                                                         |
| `OPENSEO_RATE_LIMIT`     | Audits per visitor per hour, and the same number of share previews. Defaults to 60; 0 turns it off |
| `OPENSEO_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Audits and crawls running at once. Defaults to 4                                                   |
| `OPENSEO_ALLOW_PRIVATE`  | Set to `true` to audit localhost and private networks                                              |
| `OPENSEO_USER_AGENT`     | The User-Agent sent to audited sites                                                               |
| `SMTP_URL`               | The mail server for alert emails, like `smtps://user:password@smtp.example.com:465`                |
| `SMTP_FROM`              | Who alert emails come from, like `OpenSEO <seo@example.com>`                                       |
| `OPENSEO_SCHEDULER`      | Set to `false` to stop this copy of OpenSEO running monitors                                       |

You only need `ADMIN_PASSWORD` if other people can reach your OpenSEO, like on a shared network.
Shared reports and comparisons, the home page and Share preview stay open; everything else asks
for it.

The theme (light by default, or dark, or matching the system), PageSpeed, how many links to check,
how many pages to crawl and where alerts go are in the app under **Settings**.

Branding has no form in the app. To white-label reports, set `brandName`, `brandLogo` (a URL or
data URI), `brandColor` (a hex color), `reportFooter`, `ctaText` and `ctaUrl` in
`data/settings.json`, or send them to `PUT /api/settings`. Changes apply on the next page load.

## Monitors and alerts

Under **Monitors**, add a page and pick how often to audit it: every day or every week, at an hour
in your time zone. OpenSEO audits it straight away, so later runs have something to compare
with, then on schedule for as long as it's running (keep `--restart unless-stopped` in the Docker
command). Every run is a normal audit in History, marked _Monitor_.

Each monitor alerts when:

- **The score drops** by 5 points or more since the last run (1, 3 or 10 points, or never). The
  alert names the checks that started failing and links to the before-and-after comparison.
- **The page stops loading**, and again when it's back. OpenSEO tries once more after 30 seconds
  before calling a page down.
- **The SSL certificate** is invalid, or expires within 14 days (7, 30, or never), with
  reminders at 7, 3 and 1 days.

Alerts go wherever you set up under **Settings → Alerts**, all at once:

| Channel | Set up                                                                                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email   | Add addresses in Settings, and point `SMTP_URL` at a mail server (see below)             |
| Slack   | Create an [incoming webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and paste its URL |
| Discord | In a channel's settings, open Integrations → Webhooks, create one and paste its URL      |
| Webhook | Any URL. It gets each alert as JSON, for Zapier, n8n, Make or your own code              |

**Send a test alert** in Settings checks every channel at once. Set **Links in alerts** to the
address you open OpenSEO at, so the links in alerts work.

`SMTP_URL` works with any mail provider. Use an app password for Gmail, or the SMTP details from
Resend, Postmark, Mailgun or your host:

```bash
docker run -d --name openseo --restart unless-stopped -p 3000:3000 -v openseo-data:/data \
  -e SMTP_URL='smtps://you%40gmail.com:app-password@smtp.gmail.com:465' \
  -e SMTP_FROM='OpenSEO <you@gmail.com>' \
  ghcr.io/alexsilver8/open-seo
```

Encode `@` in the user name as `%40`. Use `smtps://` with port 465, or `smtp://` with port 587
(OpenSEO upgrades to TLS when the server offers it).

The JSON webhook gets:

```json
{
	"event": "openseo.alert",
	"title": "fernhill.coffee: score dropped 7 points",
	"severity": "fail",
	"url": "https://fernhill.coffee/",
	"alerts": [
		{
			"kind": "score-drop",
			"headline": "score dropped 7 points",
			"message": "The score dropped 7 points, from 86 (A-) to 79 (B).",
			"details": ["New problems: Title tag and Meta description."]
		}
	],
	"link": "https://seo.example.com/report/a1b2c3/compare/d4e5f6",
	"monitorId": "Xy12Ab34Cd56",
	"report": { "id": "d4e5f6", "score": 79, "grade": "B" },
	"sentAt": "2026-10-12T06:00:41.000Z",
	"text": "fernhill.coffee: score dropped 7 points\n\n• The score dropped 7 points…"
}
```

`kind` is one of `score-drop`, `page-down`, `page-back`, `ssl-expiring`, `ssl-invalid` or `test`.
The `text` field holds the whole alert as plain text, which is what chat tools like Mattermost and
Google Chat read.

## API

```bash
# Audit and wait for the full report
curl -X POST https://your-openseo/api/audit \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url": "example.com", "stream": false}'

# Or stream progress as newline-delimited JSON, ending with {"type":"done","id":"…"}
curl -N -X POST https://your-openseo/api/audit -d '{"url": "example.com"}'
```

| Endpoint                             | Does                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/audit`                    | Runs an audit: `{ url, stream? }`                           |
| `GET /api/reports/:id`               | One report as JSON (public, like the report page)           |
| `GET /api/preview?url=`              | Share previews, images, icons and tags for one page         |
| `GET /api/reports`                   | History, newest first. `?domain=example.com` filters it     |
| `GET /api/compare?a=&b=`             | How report `b` differs from report `a`, check by check      |
| `POST /api/crawl`                    | Crawls a site: `{ url, maxPages? }`, streamed like audits   |
| `GET /api/crawls/:id`                | One crawl as JSON, or `?format=csv`                         |
| `GET` / `PUT /api/settings`          | Read or change settings                                     |
| `GET` / `POST /api/monitors`         | List monitors, or add one: `{ url, schedule?, alerts? }`    |
| `PATCH` / `DELETE /api/monitors/:id` | Change (`paused`, `schedule`, `alerts`) or remove a monitor |
| `POST /api/monitors/:id/run`         | Runs a monitor now, streamed like audits                    |
| `POST /api/alerts/test`              | Sends a test alert to every channel                         |
| `POST /api/mcp`                      | The MCP server (see below)                                  |

With `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set, everything except `POST /api/audit`, `GET /api/preview`,
`GET /api/reports/:id` and `GET /api/compare` needs basic auth. The audit and Share preview pages,
reports and comparisons stay public too.

## Terminal

```bash
pnpm scan example.com              # grades and what to fix
pnpm scan example.com --all        # every check
pnpm scan example.com --json       # the full report
pnpm crawl example.com --pages 200 # crawl up to 200 pages
pnpm check preview.example.com --baseline example.com  # what the GitHub Action runs
```

## GitHub Action

Audit every preview deploy and fail the pull request when its SEO gets worse. With Vercel,
Netlify or any host that reports deploys back to GitHub, add `.github/workflows/seo.yml`:

```yaml
name: SEO
on: deployment_status

jobs:
    openseo:
        if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success' && github.event.deployment.environment != 'Production'
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
            pull-requests: write
        steps:
            - uses: alexsilver8/open-seo@v0
              with:
                  url: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.environment_url || github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}
                  baseline-url: https://www.example.com
                  paths: |
                      /
                      /pricing
```

It audits each path on the preview and in production at the same time, and fails when a page:

- scores more than `max-score-drop` points (2) below production,
- fails a check that passes in production (`fail-on: warn` also counts checks that start needing
  work),
- scores below `min-score`, or doesn't load.

The results go to the run's summary and to a comment on the pull request, which later runs
update. `@v0` follows the latest release; pin a release like `@v0.3.0` or a commit to stay put.

Previews differ from production in ways that aren't the code's doing, so when the baseline is on
another host OpenSEO leaves out the `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header preview hosts add, canonical
tags (they point at production) and the domain's email records. Timings (server response,
download time and Core Web Vitals) vary between runs, so the check leaves them out too. Leave out
other checks with `ignore-checks`, like `robots-txt, ai-crawlers` if your previews block crawlers
on purpose.

Vercel asks for a login on previews by default. Create a
[Protection Bypass for Automation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/protection-bypass-automation)
secret, add it to the repository's secrets and pass it on. It's only sent to the preview's host:

```yaml
headers: |
    x-vercel-protection-bypass: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET }}
```

Without preview deploys, start the site in the job and hold it to a minimum score instead:

```yaml
- run: npm ci && npm run build && (npm start &) && npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
- uses: alexsilver8/open-seo@v0
  with:
      url: http://localhost:3000
      allow-private: true
      min-score: 80
```

| `headers`           |         | `Name: value` lines sent to the preview's host only                                       |
| `comment`           |  `true` | Comment on the pull request. Needs `pull-requests: write`                                 |

Its outputs are `passed`, `score`, `grade`, `baseline-score`, `score-change`, `new-problems`,
`fixed` and `results`, the path of a JSON file with every report, ready for
`actions/upload-artifact`. Outside GitHub, `pnpm check` takes the same settings as flags and
exits with 1 when the check fails; `pnpm check --help` lists them.

## MCP server

OpenSEO is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so AI tools like Claude and Cursor can
use it: "audit our pricing page and fix what it finds", "compare our home page with
competitor.com", "why did the score drop since last week?". It's built in at `/api/mcp`:

| Client         | Set up                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | `claude mcp add --transport http openseo http://localhost:3000/api/mcp`                                           |
| Cursor         | In `.cursor/mcp.json`: `{ "mcpServers": { "openseo": { "url": "http://localhost:3000/api/mcp" } } }`              |
| VS Code        | In `.vscode/mcp.json`: `{ "servers": { "openseo": { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:3000/api/mcp" } } }` |
| Claude Desktop | The stdio bridge below                                                                                            |

Claude Desktop starts its servers as programs, so it talks to OpenSEO through a small bridge that
ships in the Docker image. Add this to `claude_desktop_config.json` (Settings → Developer → Edit
Config):

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"openseo": {
			"command": "docker",
			"args": ["exec", "-i", "openseo", "node", "mcp-stdio.mjs"]
		}
	}
}
```

Without Docker, use `"command": "node"` and `"args": ["/path/to/open-seo/scripts/mcp-stdio.mjs"]`
while OpenSEO runs; `OPENSEO_URL` points it elsewhere.

| Tool                   | Does                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `audit_page`           | Audits a page and returns the grades and what to fix first                     |
| `get_report`           | A saved report's problems, or every check, with the evidence and how to fix it |
| `list_reports`         | Saved audits, newest first, for one site or all                                |
| `compare_reports`      | What changed between two audits, check by check                                |
| `crawl_site`           | Crawls a site and lists its issues with example pages                          |
| `get_crawl`            | A saved crawl, or every page with one issue                                    |
| `check_share_previews` | How a link looks on Google, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Slack and more              |
| `list_monitors`        | Monitors, when they run next and how the last run went                         |
| `add_monitor`          | Audits a page every day or week, with alerts                                   |

With `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set, clients sign in with basic auth: add
`--header "Authorization: Basic $(printf 'admin:your-password' | base64)"` to the Claude Code
command, or a `headers` entry with the same value in Cursor and VS Code. The bridge in the Docker
image signs in by itself, and outside it takes `OPENSEO_PASSWORD`. Like the rest of the API, MCP
audits count towards `OPENSEO_RATE_LIMIT`.

## Your data

Everything is plain JSON in the data folder:

| File                | Holds                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `reports/<id>.json` | One audit report               |
| `reports.json`      | The history index              |
| `crawls/<id>.json`  | One crawl                      |
| `crawls.json`       | The crawl index                |
| `monitors.json`     | Monitors and their recent runs |
| `settings.json`     | Branding and options           |

Back it up by copying the folder.

## Good to know

- Audits run on your server without a browser, so they see the HTML your server sends.
  Timings are measured from your server; turn on PageSpeed Insights for real-browser numbers.
- Some sites block automated requests. OpenSEO says so instead of guessing.
- OpenSEO refuses to audit private and internal addresses unless you allow it, so a public
  install can't be used to reach your own network.
- Backlinks, keyword rankings and keyword research need large paid data sets, so they aren't
  included. The audit engine is a plain module in `src/server/audit`, ready for a data provider.

## Develop

```bash
pnpm dev             # the app with hot reload
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm format
pnpm cleaner         # checks the component conventions
```

The code is laid out like this:

| Folder       | Holds                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/app`    | Next.js routes and API endpoints, kept thin               |
| `src/web`    | The React UI: shared components, screens, styles          |
| `src/server` | The audit engine, crawler, storage and limits             |
| `src/shared` | Types, grades, settings and formatting used on both sides |
| `scripts`    | The CLI and repository tooling                            |
